I created a Memory Card Game using Nickelodeon's Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon images.  

##Live Demo:

##Objective of the Game:

The objective of the game is to click on one card to flip it over and click on another to find it's match. You do this until all of the cards on the board are matched and flipped over.


##Benefits of the Game:

Playing memory games can improve other brain functions, such as attention, concentration, and focus. Memory games give space to critical thinking and that helps children nurture their attention to detail. Memory games also can improve visual recognition.
